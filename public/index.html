        Hello my name is Andrew Pascente and I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science. I am currently 
        attending Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, and I am preparing to be useful in the real world. I am currently
        unsure about what speicifc part of computer science I want to pursue, but I would like to explore as many topics as I can!
        some topics I would like to explore are computer architecture, computer graphics, artificial intelligence, and 
        designing algorithms. My main goal right now is to get an internship so that my skills for these topics can grow. 
        Thank you!
        
    </p>
